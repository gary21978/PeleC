This is a reduced version of the skeletal HyChem mechanism for A2
(Jet-A surrogate) without low temperature chemistry obtained here:

See the comments at the top of mechanism.inp for more details and citation
information.

Note that this may be a bit different from the reduced mechanism provided by
HyChem. It takes the same non-QSSA species, but rather than using the ckwyp.f
provided by HyChem, uses CEPTR to generate similar routines. Perhaps this
can lead to some minor differences.
